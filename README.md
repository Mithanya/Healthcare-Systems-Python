Healthcare IT Systems Simulator in Python
A collection of Python programs that simulate real-world hospital and biomedical workflows‚Äîfrom patient admission to ICU monitoring, built during my biomedical training.
 Overview
This project reflects my 10-day hands-on experience with biomedical devices and hospital systems. Each Python script mirrors a real healthcare workflow, demonstrating how software can improve efficiency in medical environments.
